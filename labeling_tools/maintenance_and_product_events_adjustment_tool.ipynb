    "<p> This jupyter notebook was used to adjust the timestamps of maintenance and product events. The timestamps from the events were generated with a minute precision. For most applications more detailed timestamps are necessary, hence we adapted them by hand to allow for extensive evaluation of applications like condition monitoring. </p>\n",

    "    <h3>Instructions for using the adjustment notebook</h3>\n",
    "    <p> First do all the product events, then the maintenance events for a particular day. </p>\n",
    "    <p> For each event, the event itself and a +/- 1 minute window of data is plotted. </p>\n",
    "    <p> The event was generated by the coffee maker after the procedure was finshed, hence, it can be located in the 60 seconds before or after the recorded event. </p>\n",
